          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty, Obesity</h2>
          <p>As expected there appears to be a correlation between Poverty and Obesity rates. With higher rates of Obesity reported in states with higher levels of Poverty. This correlation is likely due to lower asscess and quality of healthcare. Often times poverty can lead to lower educational attainment which directly impacts healthcare literacy rates.</p>

          <p>As depicted in the chart above there is a general trend toward higher rates for both conditions when compared to one another. However, outliers to the this trend do exsist such as DC's high rate of poverty but realtively low rates of Obesity. This highlights the importance of access to care. Since DC is a rather small area with numerous hospitals located within its confines most likely helps to lower the obesity levels due to greater access to health education and information.</p>

          <p>Overall the data shows a correaltion but reveals that more data would be needed to capture the significance of the correaltion. Many factors are weighed when examining health risks and each contributes in determing overall health risks.</p>
